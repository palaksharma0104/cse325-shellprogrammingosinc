// In Orphan Process, child process P4 goes to sleep and whenever the sleep time period is completed and P4 comes back for execution it's parent has already completed it's execution. So, it will get a garbage parent PID, whenever it wants to access it's parents PID as it is a orphan process. 
	
// In Zombie Process, the parent process P4 goes to sleep and the child process P5 executes before P4 and leaves, and then after the completion of sleep time period process P4 executes, so here child process P5 will be called zombie process beacuse it has executed before it's parent's execution, and for P4 (parent) the process P5 is still visible in it's table but it has already completed it's execution.
